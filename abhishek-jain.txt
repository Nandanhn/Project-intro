hello everyone,

My name is Abhishek Jain. Currently working as an intern in Coding Ninjas. Side by side learning different javascript frameworks.
In love with reactjs, nodejs, express. Would love to work on electron, react, redux to widen my scope.

A small project suggestion by me:- 
We can start by developing a plagiarism checker by using any of the rest-api (there are no such app written in javascript on git);
or a simple desktop app by electron or a website by react---- A tool for revision for software developers where we can give them tasks according to a fibonacci sequence.
